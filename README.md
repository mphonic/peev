# Peev

Peev is a piece of infinite music designed to enhance fortitude and persistence in the digital environment. 

It is recommended that you start peev as you are about to embark on a flurry of heterogeneous digital activities. 

Maximum psychological effects are achieved as you forget that peev is in operation.

Peev both needs and does not need you, but your subjectivity is what makes peev real.

# Usage

For the simplest usage, [download the Mac OS app](https://bhobrainey.com/store/44), open it, and hit "Go." For use with [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.github.io/download.html), you will need to have [sc3-plugins](https://github.com/supercollider/sc3-plugins) installed. Open peev.scd, double click next to the first parenthesis to select all text, and hit control-c. A window should pop up â€“ hit "Go."

Peev loads three audio files into buffers, and because Document.current is not reliable across platforms, these files may fail to load. To fix, find the following lines and change the paths to absolute paths:

sad = Buffer.read(s, Document.current.dir ++ "/audio/sax-bright-01.wav");
melo = Buffer.read(s, Document.current.dir ++ "/audio/sax-bright-02.wav");
voc = Buffer.read(s, Document.current.dir ++ "/audio/voc-01.wav");

Becomes:

sad = Buffer.read(s, "/your/path/to/audio/sax-bright-01.wav");
melo = Buffer.read(s, "/your/path/to/audio/sax-bright-02.wav");
voc = Buffer.read(s, "/your/path/to/audio/voc-01.wav");

(Many versions of the SuperCollider IDE support dragging files into the editor window to reveal their absolute paths, so do that if you're having trouble.)

Modify and share. If you care to donate to the peev cause, please [buy the app / code download package](https://bhobrainey.com/store/44).
